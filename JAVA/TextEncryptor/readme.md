# Text Encryptor

This program offers encyption and decryption of text.


### Supported cipher algorithms
This program currently support these cipher algorithms:

**1. Caesar Cipher** - named after Julius Caesar, is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a Shift of 2, **A** would become **C**, **B** would become **D**, and so on.

**2. Vigen√®re Cipher** - was renowned for being a very secure cipher, and for a very long time it was believed to be unbreakable. Although this is not true, it is still a very secure cipher.

**3. Atbash Cipher** - The Atbash cipher is a very common, simple cipher. The alphabet written in reverse orde which means that, when encoded, an "A" becomes a "Z", "B" turns into "Y", etc.

**4. Affine Cipher** - In affine cipher each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter.
